      <description>Reflecting on my non-medal performance Last July I was able to compete at the 65th IMO held in the UK as PHI1, which was a lot of fun. Being at the lectures, hanging out with my team, thinking about the problems after the test, and being in the community that I had dreamed of being in since I was like 11 was surreal to me. That being said I get to the test with no sleep on the first day but prepared on the next and my score ended up being 5/0/0 7/0/0, a full solve meaning I guaranteed myself an HM but 4 points away from a total that would have garnered me a medal, and this was perhaps the best result I could have asked for.</description>
