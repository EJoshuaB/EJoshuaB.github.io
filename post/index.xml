      <description>Simply notes from an oly guy.&#xA;Metric Spaces A metric space is defined like groups are, over some set of points \(M\) and some distance function \(d\) called a metric. Formally \(d: M \times M \mapsto \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}\) Any metric space has the following conditions for \(x,y,z\in M\):&#xA;\(d(x,y) \geq 0\) with equality at \(x=y\) \(d(x,y) = d(y,x)\) \(d(x,y) \leq d(x,z) + d(z,y)\), so the triangle inequality holds. Note that this is enough to imply that \(d\) is a continuous function in \(M\) by using the triangle inequality â€˜on a line.</description>

      <description>A personal favorite style of problem of mine are problems that can seem very scary but admit pretty cute/short bijection solutions, so here&amp;rsquo;s a short collection of a couple of them I did recently, with a bit of motivation and a very handwavy explanation of them.&#xA;On the easier side we have a C1 from the 2014 IMO Shortlist. The statement is as follows:&#xA;IMO Shortlist 2014 C1 Let \(n\) points be given inside a rectangle \(R\) such that no two of them lie on a line parallel to one of the sides of \(R\).</description>
