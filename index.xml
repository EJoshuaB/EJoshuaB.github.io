      <description>Simply notes from an oly guy.&#xA;Metric Spaces A metric space is defined like groups are, over some set of points \(M\) and some distance function \(d\) called a metric. Formally \(d: M \times M \mapsto \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}\) Any metric space has the following conditions for \(x,y,z\in M\):&#xA;\(d(x,y) \geq 0\) with equality at \(x=y\) \(d(x,y) = d(y,x)\) \(d(x,y) \leq d(x,z) + d(z,y)\), so the triangle inequality holds. Note that this is enough to imply that \(d\) is a continuous function in \(M\) by using the triangle inequality â€˜on a line.</description>

      <description>A personal favorite style of problem of mine are problems that can seem very scary but admit pretty cute/short bijection solutions, so here&amp;rsquo;s a short collection of a couple of them I did recently, with a bit of motivation and a very handwavy explanation of them.&#xA;On the easier side we have a C1 from the 2014 IMO Shortlist. The statement is as follows:&#xA;IMO Shortlist 2014 C1 Let \(n\) points be given inside a rectangle \(R\) such that no two of them lie on a line parallel to one of the sides of \(R\).</description>

      <description>Reflecting on my non-medal performance Last July I was able to compete at the 65th IMO held in the UK as PHI1, which was a lot of fun. Being at the lectures, hanging out with my team, thinking about the problems after the test, and being in the community that I had dreamed of being in since I was like 11 was surreal to me. That being said I get to the test with no sleep on the first day but prepared on the next and my score ended up being 5/0/0 7/0/0, a full solve meaning I guaranteed myself an HM but 4 points away from a total that would have garnered me a medal, and this was perhaps the best result I could have asked for.</description>

      <title>About Hugo XMin</title>

      <description>XMin is the first Hugo theme I have designed. The original reason that I wrote it was I needed a minimal example of Hugo themes when I was writing the blogdown book. Basically I wanted a simple theme that supports a navigation menu, a home page, other single pages, lists of pages, blog posts, categories, tags, and RSS. That is all. Nothing fancy. In terms of CSS and JavaScript, I really want to keep them minimal.</description>
